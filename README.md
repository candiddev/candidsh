## License

The code in this repository is unlicensed.  It's our website, why would you want this?

## Development

Our development process is mostly trunk-based with a `main` branch that folks can contribute to using pull requests.  We tag releases as necessary using CalVer.

### Repository Layout

- `./github:` Reusable GitHub Actions
- `./hugo:` Candid Development website
- `./shell:` Development tooling
- `./shared:` Shared libraries from https://github.com/candiddev/shared

Make sure you initialize the shared submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

### CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions to lint, test, build, release, and deploy the code.  You can view the pipelines in the `.github/workflows` directory.  You should be able to run most workflows locally and validate your code before opening a pull request.
