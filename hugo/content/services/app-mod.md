## Focus

We can help your organization modernize existing applications into a cloud operating model:

- **Repurchase**: Decommission the application and replace with a different one, ideally a software-as-a-service (SaaS).
- **Rehost**: Lift and shift the application from one provider to another.
- **Replatform**: Lift, fix, and shift the application from one platform to another.
- **Refactor**: Fundamentally rework the application into a cloud native service.  This could be a microservice, function-as-a-service (FaaS), monolithic container, or something else entirely.
- **Retire**: If the application is no longer in use, it should be retired and the source code archived.
- **Retain**: Sometimes things can't be modernized.  Retain them for now until it's cost effective to modernize.

## Outcomes

Outcomes vary by each customer.  No application modernization journey is the same, and we will not cookie cutter you onto a path that isn't right for your organization.
